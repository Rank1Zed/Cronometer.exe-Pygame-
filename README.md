# Cronometer.exe-Pygame-
I was using this to track how much I study per day, so I made this program into an executable file.  Create a shortcut to the .exe file and run it.  Press space to save the time; it will add up the hours, minutes, and seconds of your study time for a given day.  You can exit by pressing Esc or the X exit button.
