# Cronometer.exe-Pygame-
I was using this to track how much I study per day, so I made this program into an executable file.  Create a shortcut to the .exe file and run it.  Press space to save the time; it will add up the hours, minutes, and seconds of your study time for a given day.  You can exit by pressing Esc or the X exit button.

Since GitHub doesn't allow me to upload files larger than 55 megabytes (77 MB total), even zipped ones, I only uploaded what was necessary.

Only Windows

You just need to go to your cmd and type 
"pip install pygame"
and to remove it, type 
"pip uninstall pygame"
then run main.py with the entire folder opened in a code editor

To package it into an executable .exe file, I used PyInstaller
"PyInstaller.exe.png" is an image of what the complete file would look like
"Cronometer.png" is an image of how the program works
